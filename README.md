# Late Now! üé≠üì∫

An experiment into controllable short-form show generation. For detailed information visit the [Technical Overview](https://michaelgiba.substack.com/p/late-now)

## üöÄ Usage

There are two available execution modes:

1. **Show from News Article**: 
   ```
   ./bin/show-from-article <url of article>
   ```

2. **Show from rough script**:
   ```
   ./bin/show-from-script <path to script>
   ```

The content of a script file is just a plain text file that looks like a script. For some examples, look into `show_scripts/`


## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Blender 4.2](https://www.blender.org/download/releases/4-2/) with [Autorig Pro](https://blendermarket.com/products/auto-rig-pro) installed
- Python 3.10
- GPU with at least 12 GB of VRAM (Tested on GeForce RTX 3060)


### Setup

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `./setup.sh`
3. Download the pretrained models in each of the cloned AniPortrait and MoMask repos
4. Fill out the settings in `settings.env`

## üé¨ Example Generations

## ü§ù Contributing

All contributions are welcome, some extensions include:

Optimize end-to-end generation time to seconds using multiple machines
Deploy the system as a web service for generating short, funny videos from user-provided articles
Launch a never-ending show similar to the surreal "Nothing Forever"
Extend to use 3D generation models for new characters or scenes
Implement img2img model processing for frame restyling or realism

Feel free to fork the repository, work on these ideas, or propose your own.
