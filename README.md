# Late Now! 🎭📺

An experiment into controllable short-form show generation. For detailed information visit the [Technical Overview](https://michaelgiba.substack.com/p/late-now)

## 🚀 Usage

There are two available execution modes:

1. **Show from News Article**: 
   ```
   ./bin/show-from-article <url of article>
   ```

2. **Show from rough script**:
   ```
   ./bin/show-from-script <path to script>
   ```

The content of a script file is just a plain text file that looks like a script. For some examples, look into `show_scripts/`


## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Blender 4.2](https://www.blender.org/download/releases/4-2/) with [Autorig Pro](https://blendermarket.com/products/auto-rig-pro) installed
- Python 3.10
- GPU with at least 12 GB of VRAM (Tested on GeForce RTX 3060)


### Setup

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `./setup.sh`
3. Download the pretrained models in each of the cloned AniPortrait and MoMask repos
4. Fill out the settings in `settings.env`
